# Association

**"One class is somehow associated with another class."**

Association is a common tern for both the "has-a" and "part-of" relationships, but is not limited to these. 

When we say that two objects are in an association relationship, there is a generic statement which means that we don't worry about the lifetime dependency between the objects. 

Two forms of association:
- [[Aggregation]]
- [[Composition]]
