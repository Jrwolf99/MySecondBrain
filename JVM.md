# JVM

JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, is a machine that is on a platform that wants to run the java bytecode. This JVM translates the Java bytecode into the platforms machine language.

This is a tool that is responsible for executing the java program line by line.

THIS IS THE INTERPRETER.

**Javac** is the java compiler which compiles Java code into java Bytecode.

This bytecode is had because it is much faster to interpret. 



**JVM** then, at the time of execution , interprets this bytecode into machine code line by line. 

although considered [[interpreted]], java could use JIT(Just-in-Time) [compilation](/compiled).
