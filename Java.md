# Java

**Java** is an object oriented programming languages that was first released in 1995. It's foundation was based upon it being well suited for the Web.

Java is a high level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is based on a "write once, run anywhere" concept. This is because it compiles into what's called "bytecode". this Bytecode can run on any Java virtual machine ([[JVM]]).


Java uses [[JDK]], [[JRE]], and [[JVM]] to handle the workings of Java.
