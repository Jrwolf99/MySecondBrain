# Object Oriented Programming MOC

"Programming in Classes".

**Why?**
- OOP allows you to break apart the program into bits and pieces of the problem that can be solved easily. AKA "Modularity"

**Object Oriented Programming is structured into four core concepts:**

[[Data Hiding]]
1. [[Encapsulation]]
2. [[Abstraction]]

4. [[Inheritance]]
5. [[Polymorphism]]


Also see [[Abstract classes]] and [[Interface]] as ways to implement Abstraction.


**Relationships Between Classes**

[[Inheritance]]

[[Association]]
