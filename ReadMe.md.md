This is an obsidian vault designed to implement the idea of "[[Conceptual Note Taking]]" rather than the "[[Sequential note taking]]" style. 

Start here: [[Programming]]


## The Golden Question
Always ask yourself:
	- **How can I connect this new concept with other concepts? Link them in the note if they relate.**

This allows for your brain to start to build nerological highways to remember what everything is. Kinda like how you know how to get to Target from the 4 turns you have to take from your house.
