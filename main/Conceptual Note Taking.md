# Conceptual Note Taking

Conceptual note taking is the idea of taking notes based on the *concepts* themselves, and actively **not** tracking when they are written.

This could allow these notes to be free of any form of structure, and allows them to open up new **links** to new topics. [[Obsidian]] does a great way of displaying this using the graph button. 

This idea was brought to me by [Peepnbrick's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms&t=584s).
