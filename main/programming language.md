# Programming Languages

There are plenty of programming languages. I am familiar with these:

- C++
- JavaScript
- [[Java MOC]]
- Object Object Oriented Programming languages


When writing in a programming language, also known as [[coding]]




Programs can also be structured into what is called [[Design Pattern]].
