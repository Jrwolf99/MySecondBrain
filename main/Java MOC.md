# Java

**Java** is an [[Object Oriented Programming MOC]] language that was first released in 1995. It's foundation was based upon it being well suited for the Web.

Java is a high level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is based on a "write once, run anywhere" concept. This is because it compiles into what's called "bytecode". this Bytecode can run on any Java virtual machine ([[JVM]]).


Java uses [[JDK]], [[JRE]], and [[JVM]] to handle the workings of Java.

When Java was built, 5 things were kept in mind:
	1. simple, OOP, and familiar
	2. Robust and secure
	3. architectural-neutral and portable
	4. execute with high performance
	5. [[interpreted]], [[threaded]], and [[dynamic]]

Java is [[statically typed]].

Java has a [[Collection Framwork]] designed to assist with [[algorithm]]

Java uses [[Generic]] to reuse code.
