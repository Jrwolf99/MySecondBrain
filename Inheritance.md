# Inheritance

AKA [[Is a]]

Inheritance provides a way to create a new class from an existing class.

 The new class is a specialized version of the existing class such that it inherits all the _non-private_ fields (_variables_) and _methods_ of the existing class. The existing class is used as a starting point or as a _base_ to create the new class.
 

**Remember the "IS A" relationship**

In [[Java MOC]] whenever we create a class, it inherits all the non-private methods and fields from the buildin Java **Object** class by default. This makes it a very good example of inheritance in Java. 

The methods defined in **Object** class come in very handy when making a new class.
