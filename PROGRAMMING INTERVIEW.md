# The Programming Interview

See [[Interview]] for details on normal interviewing. This page focuses on the technical parts of the interviews. 

In the technical, they care about whether or not your skillsets match up to your resume. Can you articulate the ins and outs of coding and programming? 

Can you problem solve?

Do you have what it takes to solve Leetcode mediums and hards?

### A method to get good at the programming interview
- [ ] Solve [[Leetcode]] problems
- [ ] Research and study up on the programming languages themselves
- [ ] Write and create problem-solving and purpose driven projects
- [ ] Understand "above and beyond concepts" like [[Refactoring]], [[Testing]], and [[Design Patterns]]
