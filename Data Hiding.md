# Data Hiding

Data Hiding utilizes [[Abstraction]] and [[Encapsulation]] to get the job done.

In layman’s terms, _data hiding_ refers to the concept of **hiding the inner workings of a class** and simply providing an **interface** through which the outside world can interact with the class without knowing what’s going on inside.


**Why do we want to hide data from someone accessing it?**
Think of the example of a doctor. Does a patient want to know all of the things that the doctor learned in med school just to know how to fix their own problem? Probably not.
