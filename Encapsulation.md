# Encapsulation

Ecapsulation way for programmers to implement [[Data Hiding]].

**Think of an encapsulated pill: The methods are the outter shell of the pill, and the data fields or variables is the medicine on the inside.**

Encapsulation is splitting the code into "Methods" and "Variables" where the variables are **hidden or private** but the methods are **public**. 

#### **Why?**
**Encapsulation** in OOP refers to binding the **data** and the **methods to manipulate that data** together in a single **unit** (class).

With a class in this structure, it keeps the state of whatever instance of that class to be only controlled by itself and no one else. No one else can change its data. Only itself can manipulate itself.
