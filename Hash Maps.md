# Hash Maps

A hash map is used to organize your data so you can quickly look up values for a given key. 

This is a [[data structure]].

This comes in handy for many [[algorithms]].
### Java
[[Java]] has whats called a [HashMap](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp).

```java
import java.util.HashMap; // import the HashMap class

HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>();
```
